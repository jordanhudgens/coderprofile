        <p>Everyone learns how to program differently, and what works for one student doesn't work for another. There are seemingly countless resources available on the web, however how does a student know where to start?</p>

        <p>When tasked in grad school at Texas Tech University for an artifical intelligence course to build an intelligent agent, I decided to develop a program that can generate a custom list of programming courses for students based on 15 different points of specification.</p> 

        <p>After you have answered the questions on the following page you will be supplied with a custom curriculum that will fit with your: budget, lifestyle, available time, experience and a number of other factors. Happy coding!</p>
